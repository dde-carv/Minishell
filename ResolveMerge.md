To resolve merge conflicts when merging your branch with the main branch, follow these steps:

1. **Fetch the latest changes from the main branch**:
   ```sh
   git fetch origin
   ```

2. **Checkout your branch**:
   ```sh
   git checkout your-branch-name
   ```

3. **Merge the main branch into your branch**:
   ```sh
   git merge origin/main
   ```

4. **Resolve the conflicts**:
   - Open the conflicted files in your editor. Conflicts are marked with `<<<<<<<`, `=======`, and `>>>>>>>`.
   - Edit the files to resolve the conflicts.
   - After resolving, add the resolved files to the staging area:
     ```sh
     git add path/to/resolved-file
     ```

5. **Complete the merge**:
   ```sh
   git commit
   ```

6. **Push the changes to your remote branch**:
   ```sh
   git push origin your-branch-name
   ```

After resolving the conflicts and successfully merging the main branch into your branch, you can proceed to merge your branch back into the main branch without conflicts.
